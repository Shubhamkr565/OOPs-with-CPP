### **1. Objects**

1. Create a `Car` object with attributes like brand, model, and year, and display them.
2. Create multiple `Student` objects and store them in an array.
3. Create a `Rectangle` object with methods to calculate area and perimeter.
4. Create an `Employee` object and initialize it using a constructor.
5. Create a `Book` object with methods to set and get book details.

### **2. Classes**

1. Define a `BankAccount` class with deposit and withdraw methods.
2. Define a `Time` class to add two times given in hours and minutes.
3. Define a `ComplexNumber` class to perform addition of two complex numbers. // do again
4. Define a `Person` class with name, age, and a method to display details.
5. Define a `Shape` class with methods for calculating area and volume.

### **3. Data Abstraction**

1. Create a `Car` class where only `drive()` and `brake()` methods are accessible.
2. Create a `BankAccount` class where balance is private and can be modified only by deposit and withdraw functions.
3. Create a `Temperature` class with methods to set and get temperature values securely.
4. Implement an `ATM` system where users can check balance but not modify it directly.
5. Implement a `VotingSystem` class where only eligible users can vote.

### **4. Data Encapsulation**

1. Create a `Student` class with private attributes and public getter and setter methods.
2. Implement a `Bank` class where user data is private and accessed through functions.
3. Implement an `Employee` class with private salary and public methods to set and get salary.
4. Create a `GameCharacter` class where health and power levels are encapsulated.
5. Create a `BookStore` class with private attributes for book name and price.

### **5. Inheritance**

1. Create a `Vehicle` base class and inherit `Car` and `Bike` from it.
2. Implement a `Person` base class and inherit `Employee` and `Student` from it.
3. Create a `Shape` class and inherit `Circle`, `Rectangle`, and `Triangle` from it.
4. Implement `Animal` base class and inherit `Dog` and `Cat` with their specific behaviors.
5. Create a `BankAccount` base class and inherit `SavingsAccount` and `CurrentAccount`.

---

### **6. Polymorphism**

1. Create a `Shape` class with a virtual `draw()` method and override it in `Circle`, `Square`, and `Triangle` classes.
2. Implement function overloading for `add()` to add integers, floats, and strings.
3. Create a `Vehicle` class with a `honk()` method and override it in `Car` and `Bike`.
4. Implement operator overloading for `+` to add two complex numbers.
5. Create a `Media` class with a virtual `play()` method, and override it in `Music` and `Video` classes.
